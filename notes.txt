Reactive (Dumb) X Proactive (Knowledge)


React helps by constructing the UI using VDOM which help in making DOM updates very efficient.


Component
    Encapsulation of Presentation + UI Behavior + State
    Reusable
    Customizable
    Composable

React Components
    Class Component
    Functional Component

ES6 (ECMAScript 6 / ES2015)
    1. let
    2. const
    3. Array destructuring
    4. Rest operator (array)
    5. Spread operator (array)
    6. Object destructuring
    7. Rest operator (object)
    8. Spread operator (object)
    9. Default arguments
    10. Arrow functions
    11. Template Literals
    12. Iterators (for of)
    13. Generators (functions whose execution can be suspended and resumed)
    14. Object construction enhancements
    15. Class
    (To be discussed later)
    16. Modules
    17. Promises

Day-2 Assignment
    Array Methods
        filter
        forEach
        map

Function Invocation Patterns
    1. As a method of an obj
        this -> obj
    2. As a function
        this -> global scope (window in the browser)
    3. Using the 'call' method
    4. Using the 'apply' method
    

HTML & JSX
    HTML
        Open tags without corresponding close tags are allowed
        "for" attribute is allowed
        "class" attribute is allowed
    JSX
        Every open tag MUST have a corresponding close tag
        Use "htmlFor" in place of "for" attribute
        use "className" inplace of "class" attribute


Convert the following HTML to a 'Greeter' component
<h1>Greeter</h1>
<hr>
<label for="">User Name:</label>
<input type="text" name="" id="">
<button>Greet</button>
<div>[greeting]</div>
