Reactive (Dumb) X Proactive (Knowledge)


React helps by constructing the UI using VDOM which help in making DOM updates very efficient.


Component
    Encapsulation of Presentation + UI Behavior + State
    Reusable
    Customizable
    Composable

React Components
    Class Component
    Functional Component

ES6 (ECMAScript 6 / ES2015)
    1. let
    2. const
    3. Array destructuring
    4. Rest operator (array)
    5. Spread operator (array)
    6. Object destructuring
    7. Rest operator (object)
    8. Spread operator (object)
    9. Default arguments
    10. Arrow functions
    11. Template Literals
    12. Iterators (for of)
    13. Generators (functions whose execution can be suspended and resumed)
    14. Object construction enhancements
    15. Class
    (To be discussed later)
    16. Modules
    17. Promises
    18. Async Await

Day-2 Assignment
    Array Methods
        filter
        forEach
        map
        reduce


Function Invocation Patterns
    1. As a method of an obj
        this -> obj
    2. As a function
        this -> global scope (window in the browser)
    3. Using the 'call' method
    4. Using the 'apply' method
    

HTML & JSX
    HTML
        Open tags without corresponding close tags are allowed
        "for" attribute is allowed
        "class" attribute is allowed
    JSX
        Every open tag MUST have a corresponding close tag
        Use "htmlFor" in place of "for" attribute
        use "className" inplace of "class" attribute


Convert the following HTML to a 'Greeter' component
<h1>Greeter</h1>
<hr>
<label for="">User Name:</label>
<input type="text" name="" id="">
<button>Greet</button>
<div>[greeting]</div>

Build a calculator using any of the following template
<h1>Calculator</h1>
<hr>
<input type="number" name="" id="">
<input type="number" name="" id="">
<br>
<button>Add</button>
<button>Subtract</button>
<button>Multiply</button>
<button>Divide</button>
<div>[Result]</div>


================================================

<h1>Caluclator</h1>
<hr>
<input type="number" name="" id="">
<select name="" id="">
    <option value="add">Add</option>
    <option value="subtract">Subtract</option>
    <option value="multiply">Multiply</option>
    <option value="divide">Divide</option>
</select>
<input type="number" name="" id="">
<button>Calculate</button>
<div>[Result]</div>

Solve the Salary Calculator using React

Questions
    1. If we have to use the model, why there is a 'state' feature in react components?
    2. why the controls are read-only when a 'value' is hardcoded?


Class Components
    1. Component instances need to be created
    2. Life cycle methods of the components need to be executed even when they are not overridden

Function Components
    1. Functions as components
    2. Component instances do not need to be created
    3. Life cycle methods of the components need not be executed even when they are not overridden
    4. side effects are handled using react hooks
        hooks are functions that can be used to manage state and other side effects
        hook function names must start with 'use'

State
    UI State
        - data that supports the 'presentation (UI) needs' of the application
        - it is highly UNLIKELY that a change in this state need to be recogized by other parts of the application
        - feel free to maintain this in the component (using the this.state OR React.useState() )

    App State
        - data that supports the 'business logic (business needs) of the application'
        - it is highly LIKELY that a change in this state need to be recogized by other parts of the application
        - DO NOT maintain this in the component state 
        - Maintain this data outside the component in such a way a change in this state can be easily recognized by other parts of the application


Actions
    Objects
    Must have 'type' attribute to uniquely identify an action throughout the application
    May also have optional 'payload' attribute
